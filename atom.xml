    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I only started this log last week, but figured it would be helpful to start tracking my progress at Hacker School somewhere. As a side benefit, it might give some of the people who have asked me what I&rsquo;m doing at Hacker School some insight into what a typical day might be like &mdash; though do keep in mind I&rsquo;ve likely not captured literally every single thing and this particular week was more chaotic and scattered than average.</p>

<p>This is more of an experiemental idea right now, but if it works out well, I&rsquo;ll try to post these at the end of each week.</p>

<h2>21 Jun 2013</h2>

<ul>
<li>Completed TicTacToe AI with real minimax in Python; always wins or ties. I previously created one that used a depth-based weighting system (the fewer moves it takes to reach a win/loss state and get close to a victory, the higher the &ldquo;score&rdquo;), but it sometimes did stupid things. To be fair, it didn&rsquo;t do stupid things that often, but considering the game is solveable, I figured I might as well solve it.  <a href="https://github.com/j-wang/tictactoe_ai">Link to github repo here.</a></li>
<li>Set up Haskell for emacs (haskell-mode and scion); installed cabal and hlint. Typical setup for a new language.</li>
<li>Reviewed Haskell <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Programming_guidelines">style guide</a>. Style guides are one of the first things I look at in a new language &mdash; it helps me get a flavor of what good code looks like, often informs me about some of the language&rsquo;s quirks, and usually tells me something about what is efficient or not in the language.</li>
<li>Wrote first simple program in Haskell (along the lines of simple sum functions and &ldquo;hello world&rdquo; type of things &mdash; I didn&rsquo;t bother to push it to github).</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m trying to wrap head around monads, though am largely failing. Some of the links I perused. <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Monad">Haskell wiki page on monads.</a> <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Do_notation_considered_harmful">&ldquo;Do notation considered harmful.&rdquo;</a> <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Monad_laws">Monad laws.</a></li>
<li>Talked with Martin. After our conversation and playing around with the concept in SML, I grasp it a lot better. <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> is essentially a pipeline of actions, allowing access to wrapped value to execute&hellip; largely arbitrary&hellip; operations. I imagine a mathematician and a type system research would beg to differ given the monad laws, but it&rsquo;s effectively arbitrary for IO monad operations. Return obviously just provides the wrapped function &mdash;  the definition of Maybe (in Haskell) or Option (in SML, though it isn&rsquo;t formally a monad there) is a good example.</li>
<li>At home now and I read slight more of TAPL (Types and Programming Languages, Benjamin Pierce), trying to cover the chapters leading up to 5 and 6 (untyped lambda calculus). I reviewed 5 and 6 already at Hacker School in order to participate in a study group session that talked about lambda calculus. Thinking about setting a goal around this (getting to know lambda calculus better) to implement some suggestions about concrete goals from Mel Chua during her residency at Hacker School</li>
<li>Also continued to try to get better grasp of <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/IO_inside">IO as part of Haskell</a> &mdash; I definitely still need to continue studying this concept.</li>
</ul>


<h2>22 Jun 2013</h2>

<ul>
<li>This morning, I dug a bit into concurrency, started reading about the differences between threads and processes (need to dig into this more) and how to do <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html">multiprocessing in Python</a>, at least to some extent. I&rsquo;m probably going to make some project out of this.</li>
<li>Read about the Python GIL and some of the <a href="http://ncoghlan_devs-python-notes.readthedocs.org/en/latest/python3/questions_and_answers.html">reasoning behind it</a>. Though the post didn&rsquo;t really cover the point, it definitely makes sense that allowing shared mutable state in multiple threads would cause nightmarishly unpredictable results given the language semantics (dynamic, allowing functions/classes, as giant bags of properties/functions, to be modified at any time). At some point, Python is going to have to deal with this though. Even if sequential operation with a GIL is faster now than an implementation that has to juggle locks, eventually computers will have enough cores that sequential speed won&rsquo;t make up for lack of parallelism.</li>
<li>Read a bit about <a href="http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2011/08/we-need-software-transactional-memory.html">STM for PyPy</a>. I&rsquo;m starting to get a better grasp of the concept after multiple exposures in different languages. It doesn&rsquo;t seem too much deeper than atomic, logged (and thus retryable) transactions, but that simplicity in this realm seems to be a good thing.</li>
<li>Read about stackless Python, pypy, and <a href="http://greenlet.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">greenlets</a>. I never realized that these were all related projects. They embody an interesting approach to concurrency, though like threads it seems cumbersome/very low level and error-prone. Worth trying for myself and validating that though.</li>
<li>Digressed into <a href="http://pypy.org/performance.html">Python performance factors</a>, which is interesting to think about, especially how local copies of &ldquo;global&rdquo; methods/variables speed up execution. I saw the concept appear in Python Cookbook but never really understood how it worked (e.g. why would calling a function twice in a loop vs. assigning a local variable to the <em>exact same function</em> make any difference?). At least to some degree, I imagine this connects to the factors I mentioned about (objects as giant, dynamically modifiable bags), though I never connected the two in my mind before this.</li>
<li>Read about the theory behind <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation">JIT compilers</a>. It&rsquo;s fascinating stuff. I&rsquo;m interested in potentially making one to more deeply understand the concept. Alas, I think this is a the general theme of the topics I&rsquo;m exploring, which creates a bit of an issue with the reality of how much time I have in a day&hellip;</li>
<li>Read about various <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/04/pick-a-license-any-license.html">open source licenses and why I should include one</a>. I like the MIT license, personally. Short, sweet, gives credit and doesn&rsquo;t inhibit for-profit use (probably relates to my own business-friendly bias and what i like to personally see).</li>
<li>Read random posts on <a href="http://www.boredomandlaziness.org/">Nick Coghlan&rsquo;s blog</a>; interesting to get a better sense of the Python community</li>
<li>Hacker School rooftop party &mdash; it was basically all of the coordinators&#8217; birthdays at once. Fun times, fun conversations, and I got a lot of charcoal on myself dealing with the &ldquo;grill&rdquo; (it was basically a firepit). Met a lot of great people who are doing some pretty impressive things (&hellip; though we regularly have various software world luminaries come into Hacker School or show up in our internal communications/Humbug anyhow &mdash; fascinating how small the world is and tight knit it is).</li>
</ul>


<h2>23 Jun 2013</h2>

<ul>
<li>Read about Python 3 development and <a href="http://docs.python.org/devguide/coredev.html">how to be a core developer</a>&hellip; not sure about core developer-ship &mdash; I&rsquo;m definitely not there right now &mdash; but I would like to contribute to the Python language in some way. It&rsquo;ll be interesting to keep track and see if I get to a place where I can help out on any of the <a href="http://ncoghlan_devs-python-notes.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html">major places where the community needs help</a></li>
<li>Set up julia-mode for emacs,</li>
<li>Read about <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/interviews/should-you-learn-coffeescript/">CoffeeScript</a>. It&rsquo;s an interesting idea, though I certainly need more practice with base javascript first.</li>
<li>Diverted to CSS preprocessors (SASS and LESS) at least temporarily. Compass seems to give the advantage (somewhat) to SASS, but it seems unlikely that LESS wouldn&rsquo;t include something like it eventually. Given my dislike of working with CSS&rsquo;s syntax/concept in general though, I might try to stay with Bootstrap and AngularJS &mdash; I don&rsquo;t mind someone else figuring out what the right kerning/sizing/font for various headers are and adjusting from there.</li>
<li>Julia workshop with Leah! Intro to the Julia programming language.</li>
</ul>


<h2>24 Jun 2013</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems">Ninety-Nine Haskell Problems</a>, did some of these for <a href="https://github.com/j-wang/99-Haskell-Problems">Haskell practice</a></li>
<li>Wrote a hook to allow my tictactoe AI to play online against other tictactoe AIs. In the process, I got to know Python&rsquo;s urllib a lot better. Unfortunately, I still can&rsquo;t figure out the server&rsquo;s exact API &mdash; and I figure it isn&rsquo;t worth any more effort to fine-tune it, since I won&rsquo;t be getting much learning out of the exercise at this point other than what I need to connect to this specific server.</li>
<li>Code review with Laura on tictactoe &mdash; helpful to hear feedback on code that I did previously, and to see how much I&rsquo;ve improved/wouldn&rsquo;t write things the way I did just a few months ago. It&rsquo;ll be useful to go back and do some code revisions/refactoring myself to crystalize some of my improvement over time (which is hard to see otherwise).</li>
<li>Reviewing <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/">Git Pro</a> in preparation for GitHub training at Jane Street</li>
<li>Listened to a talk by Carin Meier on controlling robots and drones using Clojure! It was hosted by Etsy, which definitely was an interesting location (with a very quirky office).</li>
</ul>


<h2>25 Jun 2013</h2>

<ul>
<li>Went to Intermediate/Advanced Git tutorial hosted at Jane Street Capital this morning. It started a bit slow, but was really useful in bolstering my understanding of the tool, especially coming from a non-professional (programming) background and never having used a lot of the collaboration or branching functionality in a serious way.</li>
<li>Reading <a href="http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/papers/cidr11-bloom.pdf">Berkeley Bloom paper</a> in preparation for Systems discussion group.</li>
<li>Did a code reading for one of the earliest commits for bottle (commit HEAD~820 / SHA hash: 4f50cece28b8ee3ff1c5bcf3f8a7bd1d3bbf6128). It&rsquo;s really interesting to see how the author put together the pieces of it and the design decisions that went into it. My group also discovered a bad bug in the regex/special URL handling that I imagine got fixed in the later revisions (bottle sequentially loops through a list of regexes to match against a URL &mdash; however, this means a more general regex will always match first; compounding on this, there&rsquo;s a semi-random optimizing process that brings more frequently matched regexes forward in the list&hellip; which in the case of a very general match, would ultimately and self-reinforcingly end up in front and block any other matches from ever being reached).</li>
<li>Coming out of the bottle code reading session, I worked with my group in wrangling with the Python <code>@property</code> decorator (and decorator syntax more generally) and <code>@x.setter</code> syntax</li>
<li>Talked with Tom and learned about &ldquo;magic methods&rdquo; and how they work (<code>__get__</code>, <code>__set__</code>, <code>__setattr__</code>, <code>__getattr__</code>, <code>__setattribute__</code>, <code>__getattribute__</code>) &mdash; really interesting, and much more magic than I expect most users would need/understand&hellip; That being said, to really get to understand/know Python, I&rsquo;ll definitely need to understand how those work and how they fit into its evaluation model.</li>
<li>More learning about monads in Haskell from <a href="http://blog.sigfpe.com/2006/08/you-could-have-invented-monads-and.html">yet another blog post</a>. I did a fair number of the exercises, which was useful. I haven&rsquo;t uploaded them to github, but maybe I will later (if I finish them).</li>
<li>For the heck of it, I did learn how <a href="http://lambda.jstolarek.com/2012/10/code-testing-in-haskell/">Haskell testing frameworks work</a> (test-framework, HUnit, QuickCheck2), through testing my Monads tutorial exercises. This definitely was not the cost-effective project to learn this from (given that I probably didn&rsquo;t need tests at all), but I did need to learn sometime. In general, I should tighten up my testing discipline &mdash; out of the major &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; (clean, readable code, clear documentation, etc.), I am currently the most lax/entirely negligent on rigorous and systematic testing. I rely on my &ldquo;mental interpreter&rdquo; too much, which while important, shouldn&rsquo;t substitute for good tests. Not being a professional programmer, I just have never needed the discipline.</li>
<li>In the same vein (best practices and getting to know the Haskell ecosystem at least), I&rsquo;ve been learning about how Haskell modules work.</li>
<li>Reading from Computer Systems: A Programmer&rsquo;s Perspective (Bryant, O&#8217;Hallaron); probably going to continue reading this book and try to do questions from it</li>
</ul>


<h2>26 Jun 2013</h2>

<ul>
<li>Finished reading <a href="http://www.bloom-lang.net/calm/">Bloom paper</a> and researching <a href="http://databeta.wordpress.com/2010/10/28/the-calm-conjecture-reasoning-about-consistency/">CALM</a> principles. These weren&rsquo;t actually the papers I was supposed to read though&hellip; I&rsquo;m hoping they give me a better foundational understanding for Dedalus paper, which we are actually discussing.</li>
<li>Briefly went through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming">logic programming</a>, in order to better understand the Dedalus paper; I certainly barely scratched the surface, but I understand the basics of it now &mdash; hopefully enough for the paper &mdash; after seeing examples like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_clause">Horn clause</a>. Formal logic from philosophy in college is starting to come back to me&hellip;</li>
<li>Discussed <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2009/EECS-2009-173.pdf">Dedalus</a> with Systems reading paper group &mdash; I have a better sense of it now after working through it with the group, though I still don&rsquo;t entirely understand how Dedalus gracefully handles asyncronous data/information &mdash; at least not explicitly. I do understand the idea of how the timestamps would work with eventual consistency (rules come in later that help lead to consistency), but not how they literally make this happen. I&rsquo;ll reread the paper later, but that part seemed a bit fuzzy (though there were certainly enough dense sections that I could have missed it).</li>
<li>More discussion on monads, functors, and their mathematical properties with Nabil, Alex, and Alice</li>
<li>Listened to a talk about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHK-uS-Iedc">miniKanren</a></li>
<li>Set up <a href="http://j-wang.net">octopress blog</a> on github pages with custom domain</li>
<li>Migrated posts (or at least downloaded them) from my Blogger blog</li>
<li>Updated blog colors, poked around how octopress/jekyll liquid templates work</li>
<li>Haskell meetup: I Accidentally the Entire Heap: How I Learned to Love the Profiler. Listened to <a href="https://www.bitba.se/i-accidentally-the-entire-heap/">this presentation</a>. If nothing else, this definitely served as a wake-up call for me to pay a <em>lot</em> more attention to how laziness affects the evaluation of Haskell programs. I imagine my lack of mental model familiarity with it is going to bite me at some point (probably sooner rather than later). Aside from the content of the meetup, I also thought that it was really interesting to see the strong (and seemingly consistent, based on peoples&#8217; familiarity with each other) community around the language. I&rsquo;m going to look forward to seeing what sort of communities there are in the Bay Area.</li>
</ul>


<h2>27 Jun 2013</h2>

<ul>
<li>Came in early this morning to participate in a Javascript seminar led by Mary on javascript (of course) and higher order functions</li>
<li>Discussed characteristics of <code>this</code> in javascript along with how closures work in javascript with Mary</li>
<li>Finished pretty basic implementation (after discussing with Mary) for <a href="https://github.com/j-wang/javascript-exercises">map and reduce</a>. My misunderstanding of <code>this</code> was definitely holding me back from writing better patterns. However, I don&rsquo;t think I love the particular quirks in javascript or its general evaluation/scoping model (yeah, I know, join the club, right?).</li>
<li>Worked a bit more on my <a href="http://j-wang.net">blog</a> (this post will actually be on my blog &mdash; very meta, huh?). Pushed/uploaded posts from my old blog (which is still linking to my blogger site for images&hellip; definitely need to fix that) and pushed updated color scheme. Nothing dramatic, but I do like the slight dash of subtle color, vs. the default octopress black on gray, on white.</li>
<li>It seems I have ended up working a bit longer on my site than I expected. I messed up and did <code>git checkout source</code> (which was behind my detached HEAD in git) &mdash; needed to do a bit of recovery with <code>git reflog</code> and moving everything up to the most-updated blog state. It seems the git tutorial came in handy very quickly after all.</li>
<li>While working on my site anyway, I debugged Disqus comments not working on my site&hellip; after digging into the liquid template, it looked like I needed to specify the comments = true in the front-matter for each page.</li>
<li>I started writing my untyped lambda calculus interpreter in Python (which I probably should have started a few days ago). <a href="https://github.com/j-wang/untyped-lambda-calculus-interpreter">Here&rsquo;s the link to it</a>, though it definitely isn&rsquo;t ready for primetime&hellip; or even to be run. I&rsquo;m currently only as far as the lexer.</li>
<li>I also started it in Haskell (actually flipping between the two for a while&hellip;), but I don&rsquo;t think I have enough experience in it yet to do so efficiently, even though it&rsquo;s likely the more natural fit for an interpreter.</li>
<li>While writing the lexer, I learned a lot about regular expressions (specifically for Python, but also more broadly applicable). Funny how these projects end up creating paths that help me learn things that I never thought I would when I began the project&hellip; (though I probably should have anticipated this for an <em>interpreter</em>).</li>
<li>Read some of &ldquo;The Mythical Man Month.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a very interesting book. Many of the principles/challenges are similar to what I saw in the investment world (creative, technical field). Essentially, I take away that it&rsquo;s important (as I learned in that field) to manage so that you can accomplish what you need to do with a realistic amount of time and available resources &mdash; to crunch it is just to create a train wreck. You might get halfway to your goal, but you didn&rsquo;t get all the way and left a large mess that you&rsquo;ll need ot clean up later. I&rsquo;m pretty happy that the field in general seems to care deeply about craftsmanship and code beauty though.</li>
</ul>


<h2>28 Jun 2013</h2>

<ul>
<li>Played D&amp;D with other batch members &mdash; never played before, so it was interesting and fun. I definitely can imagine that one&rsquo;s experience will depend greatly on the group you gather though. Fortunately, we have a good one among Hacker Schoolers!</li>
<li>Read more of &ldquo;The Mythical Man Month&rdquo;</li>
<li>Slowest coding day since I started Hacker School, but at least there was great bonding time!</li>

    <updated>2013-03-28T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://j-wang.net/blog/2013/03/28/barefoot-running-and-half-marathons</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been &ldquo;barefoot running&rdquo; now for about a year at this point. Overall, I think the results have been better than expected &mdash; though my original expectations were pretty low.</p>

<p>While some people get into barefoot running because they&rsquo;ve read about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarahumara_people">Tarahumara</a>, decided it&rsquo;s the secret behind African Olympic success in running, or heard some interesting biomechanical or evolutionary argument, I admit that I primarily got into it because the shoes are more compact and easier to carry in my work bag (my company has a gym). Given that benefit, I decided I&rsquo;d just hope that some of the other touted benefits were true.</p>

These squish a lot better than running shoes.</span></span></div>

<p>One lesson that I would impart on those who might be interested in also trying out barefoot running is to take it slow. For instance, no matter what you do, don&rsquo;t make your first major experience barefoot running your first time running a half-marathon. If you do, you might look like this guy:</p>

<div align='center'><div align='center' style='max-width: 460px;'><span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='http://j-wang.net/images/posts/running1.png' width='214' height='299' alt='What a glamour shot. An example of one of many pictures of me taken during the NY13.1. I'll happily buy one of these race photos when someone actually manages to take a flattering one.' title='What a glamour shot. An example of one of many pictures of me taken during the NY13.1. I'll happily buy one of these race photos when someone actually manages to take a flattering one.'><span class='caption-text'>What a glamour shot. An example of one of many pictures of me taken during the NY13.1. I&#8217;ll happily buy one of these race photos when someone actually manages to take a flattering one.</span></span></div></div>


<p>This was the Allstate New York 13.1 around April of last year. I didn&rsquo;t do too badly for my first half-marathon &mdash; 2:09:28, which is a little under 10 minutes a mile. However, one thing that&rsquo;s definitely true with barefoot running and Vibrams is that you <em>feel</em> the road much more. That&rsquo;s usually billed as a good thing. That&rsquo;s actually less of a good thing near the end of 13 miles, feeling every dip, chip, and rock in the road on your blistering feet.</p>

<p>Now, I didn&rsquo;t actually go run the half marathon entirely unprepared. I exercise pretty regularly, and during this particular month started ramping up my regime to 3-5 miles each workout (I normally do one at a very fast pace each workout). Despite this (admittedly sparse, but not zero) preparation, the two things that really got me were not enough callouses on the side of my toes and on the ball of my foot (they ripped and tore from the unfamiliar motion/shoes), and not enough calf conditioning.</p>

<p>The rips and tears are self-explanatory and probably could stand for me not making them any more graphic. Nowadays, I wear &ldquo;toe socks&rdquo; so that I don&rsquo;t get as much chaffing, which seem to work pretty well (if only I&rsquo;d used them for any of my races&hellip; oh well, next time&hellip;). On the calf side, there was a week or two of limping and very staccato stair-stepping (couldn&rsquo;t really bend my legs too well &mdash; I kind of looked like a clockwork toy clattering down stairs).</p>

<p>Despite my complaining, running barefoot did have one particularly large benefit for me &mdash; the lack of &ldquo;arch pain.&rdquo; Before barefoot running, I&rsquo;d always had extreme pain in my arches (which are actually less arches and more, well, lines) whenever I ran for long periods of time. I originally thought that it had to do with my shoes, but it didn&rsquo;t seem like any particular pair of shoes made the problem go away (I had a pair of New Balances that helped a bit, but didn&rsquo;t fix it). Although the pain went away a few hours after running, it always vaguely worried me since it didn&rsquo;t feel particularly healthy. This time, though I certainly had other complaints, I didn&rsquo;t have this particular problem.</p>

<p>Since then, I&rsquo;ve run another half marathon and a 10k. Both have been &ldquo;barefoot&rdquo; in Vibrams. I think I&rsquo;ll definitely keep running these races, since they give me good exercise &ldquo;goals,&rdquo; which I&rsquo;ve lacked since college crew and martial arts. I&rsquo;ll probably also continue to run barefoot as well &mdash; the shoes are still compact and on net it does seem beneficial. Now, if only I could be more photogenic during these things&hellip;</p>

    <id>http://j-wang.net/blog/2013/03/18/strange-prank-idea</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Liz and I were recently up in Philly when I got an idea for a prank that I&rsquo;m a couple years too old for at this point. Liz got into UPenn&rsquo;s Integrated Product Design master&rsquo;s program last week, so we were visiting the city and school to get a sense of whether or not she&rsquo;d like the program.</p>

<p>At one point, going around the city, we saw this statue very prominently stationed at an intersection.</p>

<p>It kind of looked like it was supposed to be Socrates or something. However, the odd thing was how worn it was. The features were extremely indistinct and it kind of looked like someone had sandblasted it. I doubt that its appearance was caused by the wear of time, since it didn&rsquo;t look that old. In reality, some sculptor had probably decided that this was an interesting (if odd) style.</p>

<p>Now, even though it probably wasn&rsquo;t how it actually got this way, what if someone did&nbsp;sandblast (or sandpaper) it and just left it in this state?</p>

<p>Then, I got to thinking &mdash; how baffling and strange a prank would it be to find a statue and in the middle of the night sand it down? I&rsquo;m imagining stone statues, wooden cigar store Indians, or one of those foam statues of famous characters sometimes in front of video/comic book stores beckoning you in. You would leave it recognizable, but just make the features indistinct. Make it fuzzy. Then, after doing the deed, you would clean away the dust to make it look like nothing ever happened. I would imagine, for at least a few seconds, maybe up to a minute, someone familiar with the statue would go up to it and be completely baffled, trying (and perhaps failing) to comprehend what happened. A true epistemological mystery. The idea of bafflement and people trying to figure out what happened, along with the pure physical difficulty in executing the prank (partially what makes it so unthinkable), is what makes this so amusing to me. After all, I was baffled myself with this statue and it probably isn&rsquo;t even what happened here.</p>

<p>As said, I&rsquo;m too old for this since this is more of a college kid type of thing (especially since it might be a LONG night of sandpapering). Though, admittedly, even when I was in college I likely wouldn&rsquo;t have done this, since I think I&rsquo;d feel bad for whoever created the statue and for those who actually liked it (unless the statue was really bad). Thinking about it did give me a moment of devious (philosophical) amusement though.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For Valentine&rsquo;s Day, I surprised Liz with an iPad Mini. We were selling her current Macbook Air because it just didn&rsquo;t have the power to run Solidworks, Autocad, and other technical programs she&rsquo;d soon need for her engineering/design classes. However, she attached a fair amount of sentimental value to that particular Macbook Air (it was another surprise gift from me). I figured I&rsquo;d at least update the sentimental value with the iPad because it filled her need for a portable device and she had liked the Mini when we visited an Apple Store recently.</p>

<p>For her gift, she surprised me with a Raspberry Pi. In a pie.</p>

<p>Apparently, she had searched for a good &ldquo;pie proxy&rdquo; as a presentation tool for the Raspberry Pi but eventually, for lack of a better option, settled on an actual pie (blueberry, but close enough). I don&rsquo;t have a picture of the pie, unfortunately, but I do have a picture of the blueberry stained box, which I vacuum sealed afterwards in case I needed any of the numbers on it (it&rsquo;d otherwise be sticky and good luck cleaning off the box without destroying it).</p>

    <link href="http://j-wang.net/blog/2012/10/06/sous-vide-porchetta/"/>
    <updated>2012-10-06T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://j-wang.net/blog/2012/10/06/sous-vide-porchetta</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One thing that has bothered me about all of my experimentation with sous vide cooking is that everything that I&rsquo;ve done could technically be done with normal cooking methods. Despite making the best chicken, steak, and poached eggs (or the only poached eggs) that I&rsquo;ve ever made, it was possible for me to still cook this food with more conventional methods. I wanted something that is largely unachievable with any other method.</p>

<p>Enter the deep-fried porchetta, which I was inspired to make from <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2011/12/the-food-lab-deep-fried-sous-vide-36-hour-all-belly-porchetta.html?ref=search">this recipe</a></p>

<p>It pretty much captures <a href="http://j-wang.net/blog/2012/01/29/theory-of-sous-vide/">what I love</a> about sous vide &mdash; the ability to separate sterilizing food from creating the texture of food. Porchetta is hard because it&rsquo;s difficult to fully cook the meat, keep the inside tender, and make the outside crispy (but not dry) all at the same time. That&rsquo;s because there&rsquo;s only one blunt object method of cooking it used (dry heat blasted outside in). Here, we can elegantly separate the parts (sterilization and tenderizing, vs. crisping&hellip; or deep-frying) by using separate cooking techniques, the key ones being sous vide and deep-frying. I couldn&rsquo;t wait to try it.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Because this thing was going to need to run overnight, I didn&rsquo;t want to chance burning down my apartment with my homemade sous vide machine. I figured I made enough food with sous vide that it would be worth it to finally spring for a real immersion circulator (Williams-Sonoma&rsquo;s Sous Vide Professional, after deciding that it was too much trouble making sure used lab circulators on Ebay didn&rsquo;t have deadly residue).</p>

<p>The recipe above calls for pork belly, but I didn&rsquo;t want to do pork belly. I couldn&rsquo;t find it at my local butcher (&hellip; Stop-and-Shop) and I make food to eat over many meals. Pork belly would be too rich and would become painful to continue eating relatively quickly (it&rsquo;s quite far past the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/23/health/23well.html?_r=0">bliss point</a>). Instead, I chose to go with 10lbs of skin-on pork shoulder, which I got tied and scored at Stop-and-Shop (it&rsquo;s important to get it tied &mdash; refuse to get it scored if you must, but the thing will fall apart on you if you don&rsquo;t have extra support from the ties).&nbsp;I figured it was a bit of a waste to go much smaller, since I&rsquo;d still have the fixed cost of going through all the steps of making this thing regardless of how big it was. As it turns out, if I went smaller, I might have ended up with less oil burns and less stress trying to manhandle a massive hunk of hot pork, but hindsight is 20/20&hellip;</p>

<div align='center'><div align='center'><span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='http://j-wang.net/images/posts/IMG_9462.JPG' width='' height='' alt='The pork shoulder fresh from the store.

<p>After getting it back from the store, I prepared the spice blend I wanted to use (toasted fennel seed, black pepper, sage, rosemary, thyme, and crushed red pepper &mdash; I wanted to go with fennel pollen, but I took a look at the expense and decided maybe another time). The toasted fennel seed and black pepper mix gets pretty aromatic when you&rsquo;re making it, which is great. Make sure you don&rsquo;t use oil though, since it&rsquo;s meant to toast dry. After toasting the seeds and peppers on the stove until deep brown, I blended them and coated them onto the shoulder, along with the other spices.</p>

<p>After patting the meat down well with spices and salt, I just needed to load it into the sous vide and used a jumbo hefty bag (2.5 gallons) as my &ldquo;vacuum bag.&rdquo; It was far more painful than the picture suggests given the size of this thing and the logistics of trying to load a 10 pound pork shoulder with one hand and keep the bag open with the other. Additionally, the hefty bag leaks slightly, which was annoying for me and could be even more problematic for you if you chose to buy one of those potentially deadly immersion circulators from Ebay. Prior to this episode, I always used simple ziplock bags, which basically work as well as vacuum seal bags for most applications and can actually handle liquids (which get sucked out by normal vacuum sealers, unless you spring for a chamber vacuum). If you lower a ziplock bag into warm-to-hot water, the pressure from the water (more heat = more molecular movement/bouncing) pushes out the air.</p>

<p>After this episode, I&rsquo;ve moved on to bulk vacuum seal bags (really big ones and 200 ft of them) bought from an online restaurant supply store to be used with a simple Foodsaver vacuum (which Liz got practically for free from a thrift store). But again, that&rsquo;s not to say that the simple technique doesn&rsquo;t work, which I want to emphasize because I&rsquo;ve heard from some people that the cost of the equipment deters them from cooking sous vide. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the fact that I&rsquo;d make porchetta again and was able to obtain the necessary equipment on the cheap, I&rsquo;d probably still be using ziplock bags.</p>

<p>The recipe calls for 155 degrees F for 36 hours but I didn&rsquo;t want to wait that long. I squinted at bit at the pasteurization curves for meat and figured out that 165 degrees F for 24 hours would suffice instead to sterilize the pork. I expected that the temperature difference wouldn&rsquo;t have much of an adverse effect on the texture either.</p>

<p>When 24 hours finally passed, it was time to deep fry. I went with the recipe&rsquo;s suggestion to use a wok with oil (I used canola because of its high smoke point, relative healthiness, and price), since my thift-store deep-fryer isn&rsquo;t big enough and while I was fine with sous vide cooking with it, I&rsquo;m not confident enough in it to go high-temp with oil.</p>

<p>Dropping the thing into the wok was somewhat painful. I think I need rubber gloves since although the shoulder was cooked at sub-boiling temperatures, it is still really hot for bare hands. I first poured off the juice/sauce/drippings into a bowl for gravy later and (for lack of better tools) grabbed the pork with my hands and manhandled it into the wok. It made a nice dual oil splash from the impact and the contact of residual moisture with the oil. I would suggest getting rubber gloves.</p>

<p>Despite the pain, I&rsquo;d say the end results were worth it. When it was done, this thing was tender enough that one of the bones slid out on its own accord. But that&rsquo;s not even the best thing. Take a look at the skin.</p>

<p>This experiment was definitely worth it and I&rsquo;ll be doing it again. The only problem is that it&rsquo;s hard to eat much porchetta in one sitting, but I suppose that I did want to get a lot of meals out of it&hellip;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For a few months now, I&rsquo;ve been using a $25 deep fryer I found at an estate sale to cook sous vide. It has a bit of a crack and is somewhat old, so I&rsquo;d probably hesitate using it for real deep frying, but I wasn&rsquo;t intending to deep fry with it anyway.</p>

<div align='center'><div align='center'><span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='http://j-wang.net/images/posts/deep_fryer.jpg' width='' height='' alt='This thing was definitely a steal for the price... though maybe not for someone who actually wanted to do some deep frying -- you'd have to factor in potential medical bills.

Not good enough.</span></span></div></div>


<p>It has a built-in thermocouple, has a nice metal basket with handle to pull the heated food out when done, and already has its own (powerful) heating element &mdash; essentially it has all the components necessary for a good sous vide machine. I even tested its temperature accuracy against a trustworthy thermometer and it came out pretty close. What could be better?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Well, one problem is that the lowest temperature setting on it was still rather high. 175 degrees F, its lowest setting, is higher than the temperature you would use to cook most food sous vide. While I&rsquo;d be able to sterilize food in a reliable way, I can&rsquo;t use this thing (or at least its built-in temperature regulation) to get the tender, moist results most people associate with sous vide. The food I produce from this setup closer resembles the output of more conventional cooking techniques.</p>

<p>One solution I could take was to buy an external temperature regulator that simply switched the power for the deep fryer on and off. This would mean that I would be able to use its basket and heating element, but just substitute out the thermoregulation.</p>

<p>However, I stumbled across this post on <a href="http://seattlefoodgeek.com/2010/02/diy-sous-vide-heating-immersion-circulator-for-about-75">Seattle Food Geek</a> and decided that building my own solution would be much more fun. Plus, since this build would be for an immersion circulator type of device instead of an all-in-one machine like the deep fryer (or the Sous Vide Supreme), I could use any size container and accommodate any amount of food.</p>

<p>I essentially followed the instructions given on the site, though I made it modular (I plug in the heating element instead of having it built-in), and mine doesn&rsquo;t look nearly as slick.</p>

<p>There is also an element of electrocution risk in mine, since although I soldered the connections well and topped them with lens caps, there&rsquo;s still a fair amount of naked wire protruding (probably not good for an application that inherently involves being around a large amounts of water). I probably wouldn&rsquo;t feel comfortable leaving it on overnight. Pictures and explanations below:</p>

<p>I did think about using this setup to control my deep fryer, but quickly realized that the built-in relay in my PID is rated for voltage that is WAY lower. I would need to install a more robust external relay in order to actually be able to push the machine to be able to handle that kind of electrical throughput &mdash; at the moment, the PID is barely rated enough for more than one immersion heating element. Putting the external relay in would also require some rewiring to bypass the PID&rsquo;s relay element, which is probably more than I want to do in the near term (I actually have the solid state relay I want to use already). For now, I&rsquo;m pretty happy that I have something that will finally give me my perfectly cooked steaks, chicken, and anything else I want to toss into it.</p>

    <updated>2012-01-29T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://j-wang.net/blog/2012/01/29/theory-of-sous-vide</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post gets a bit technical and geeky, but I think understanding the theory of cooking is pretty important to cooking well (and consistently). And I can&rsquo;t stop talking about to people in person anyway, so what the heck.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve experimented with a lot of different cooking techniques over time (clay bakers, pressure cookers, etc.), but nothing has really excited me as much as sous vide. What I really love about sous vide is that it lets you very cleanly separate the two essential goals of cooking:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sterilization of food</li>
<li>Tenderizing/texturizing food</li>
</ol>


<!-- more -->


<p>Now, what is it? Sous vide is a cooking technique that aims to evenly cook food through bringing it to a very precisely controlled, even temperature. How it is literally implemented is through placing food in vacuum sealed plastic bags, which are then placed in temperature-controlled water. Vacuum sealing (or, as I prefer, ziplock bagging and pressing out the air) is necessary in order to expose the food to the water more directly. Air is a pretty good insulator, so if it was in between the water and the food, it would prevent the food from getting to the temperature you want it to get to. The water is there because it has a&nbsp;very high specific heat, so it takes a lot of energy to change its temperature. This means it can keep a stable temperature and hold large amount of energy for transfer.</p>

<p>So, what&rsquo;s so great about this? Well, normally, most cooking techniques just blast heat at food in the attempt to sterilize it and give it an appealing texture. Unfortunately, these two goals are often at crossed purposes. To be safe, we normally heat food to a temperature that instantly kills the bacteria we&rsquo;re worried about &mdash; this ensures that it&rsquo;s safe, but often at the cost of taste and texture.&nbsp;Anyone who&rsquo;s eaten a very dry steak can tell you that absolutely-safely-cooked steak is not necessarily tasty steak.</p>

<p>Normally, it&rsquo;s a bit of an iffy proposition when skewing beneath the instant-kill temperature. Bacteria actually die off at lower temperatures than the recommended temperatures we&rsquo;re familiar with (160 &ndash; 165 degrees F for pork, and chicken, 145 degrees F for steak), but they do so gradually. If you cook at lower temperatures, safety requires good timing, which becomes potentially dangerous enough in the wrong hands that the FDA just always cites instant-kill temperatures.</p>

<p>With sous vide, you take the art (and potential food poisoning) out of the picture and add scientific precision. Sous vide machines are usually accurate enough that you know precisely what temperature the food has been at, and then it becomes a simple matter of looking up the amount of time to get to safety on a food pasteurization table. From there, you can have completely safe food (without blasted and barren texture), which, if you want more flavor/texture, you can apply judiciously without the necessity of hitting instant-kill temperature. For example, browning adds flavor through the mallaird reaction (which doesn&rsquo;t happen in sous vide). You can either use a food torch or just toss the steak/chicken/whatever onto a hot pan for a few seconds, keeping the internal texture while getting the browning. You can do sous vide with anything (even just a pot of water, a stove, thermometer, and a lot of patience), but in general machine controlled is better. I recently got a deep fryer at an estate sale that I&rsquo;m not confident in deep-frying in, but can heat water and sous vide with. Unfortunately, the low end of its temperature is still rather high (for sous vide) so I&rsquo;ll probably be experimenting with putting together my own setup soon.</p>
