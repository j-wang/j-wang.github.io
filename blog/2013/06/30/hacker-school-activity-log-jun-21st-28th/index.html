<div class="entry-content"><p>I only started this log last week, but figured it would be helpful to start tracking more of what I do at Hacker School, apart from my bigger projects. As a side benefit, it might give some of the people who have asked me what I&rsquo;m doing at Hacker School some insight into what a typical day might be like &mdash; though do keep in mind I&rsquo;ve likely not captured literally every single thing and this particular week was more chaotic and scattered than average.</p>

<p>This is more of an experimental idea right now, but if it works out well, I&rsquo;ll try to post these at the end of each week.</p>

<h2>21 Jun 2013</h2>

<ul>
<li>Completed TicTacToe AI with real minimax in Python; always wins or ties. I previously created one that used a depth-based weighting system (the fewer moves it takes to reach a win/loss state and get close to a victory, the higher the &ldquo;score&rdquo;), but it sometimes did stupid things. To be fair, it didn&rsquo;t do stupid things that often, but considering the game is solvable, I figured I might as well solve it.  <a href="https://github.com/j-wang/tictactoe_ai">Link to github repo here.</a></li>
<li>Set up Haskell for emacs (haskell-mode and scion); installed cabal and hlint. Typical setup for a new language.</li>
<li>Reviewed Haskell <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Programming_guidelines">style guide</a>. Style guides are one of the first things I look at in a new language &mdash; it helps me get a flavor of what good code looks like, often informs me about some of the language&rsquo;s quirks, and usually tells me something about what is efficient or not in the language.</li>
<li>Wrote first simple program in Haskell (along the lines of simple sum functions and &ldquo;hello world&rdquo; type of things &mdash; I didn&rsquo;t bother to push it to github).</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m trying to wrap head around monads, though am largely failing. Some of the links I perused. <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Monad">Haskell wiki page on monads.</a> <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Do_notation_considered_harmful">&ldquo;Do notation considered harmful.&rdquo;</a> <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Monad_laws">Monad laws.</a></li>
<li>Talked with Martin. After our conversation and playing around with the concept in SML, I grasp it a lot better. <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> is essentially a pipeline of actions, allowing access to wrapped value to execute&hellip; largely arbitrary&hellip; operations. I imagine a mathematician and a type system research would beg to differ given the monad laws, but it&rsquo;s effectively arbitrary for IO monad operations. Return obviously just provides the wrapped function &mdash;  the definition of Maybe (in Haskell) or Option (in SML, though it isn&rsquo;t formally a monad there) is a good example.</li>
<li>At home now and I read slight more of TAPL (Types and Programming Languages, Benjamin Pierce), trying to cover the chapters leading up to 5 and 6 (untyped lambda calculus). I reviewed 5 and 6 already at Hacker School in order to participate in a study group session that talked about lambda calculus. Thinking about setting a goal around this (getting to know lambda calculus better) to implement some suggestions about concrete goals from Mel Chua during her residency at Hacker School</li>
<li>Also continued to try to get better grasp of <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/IO_inside">IO as part of Haskell</a> &mdash; I definitely still need to continue studying this concept.</li>
</ul>


<h2>22 Jun 2013</h2>

<ul>
<li>This morning, I dug a bit into concurrency, started reading about the differences between threads and processes (need to dig into this more) and how to do <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html">multiprocessing in Python</a>, at least to some extent. I&rsquo;m probably going to make some project out of this.</li>
<li>Read about the Python GIL and some of the <a href="http://ncoghlan_devs-python-notes.readthedocs.org/en/latest/python3/questions_and_answers.html">reasoning behind it</a>. Though the post didn&rsquo;t really cover the point, it definitely makes sense that allowing shared mutable state in multiple threads would cause nightmarishly unpredictable results given the language semantics (dynamic, allowing functions/classes, as giant bags of properties/functions, to be modified at any time). At some point, Python is going to have to deal with this though. Even if sequential operation with a GIL is faster now than an implementation that has to juggle locks, eventually computers will have enough cores that sequential speed won&rsquo;t make up for lack of parallelism.</li>
<li>Read a bit about <a href="http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2011/08/we-need-software-transactional-memory.html">STM for PyPy</a>. I&rsquo;m starting to get a better grasp of the concept after multiple exposures in different languages. It doesn&rsquo;t seem too much deeper than atomic, logged (and thus retry-able) transactions, but that simplicity in this realm seems to be a good thing.</li>
<li>Read about stackless Python, pypy, and <a href="http://greenlet.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">greenlets</a>. I never realized that these were all related projects. They embody an interesting approach to concurrency, though like threads it seems cumbersome/very low level and error-prone. Worth trying for myself and validating that though.</li>
<li>Digressed into <a href="http://pypy.org/performance.html">Python performance factors</a>, which is interesting to think about, especially how local copies of &ldquo;global&rdquo; methods/variables speed up execution. I saw the concept appear in Python Cookbook but never really understood how it worked (e.g. why would calling a function twice in a loop vs. assigning a local variable to the <em>exact same function</em> make any difference?). At least to some degree, I imagine this connects to the factors I mentioned about (objects as giant, dynamically modifiable bags), though I never connected the two in my mind before this.</li>
<li>Read about the theory behind <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation">JIT compilers</a>. It&rsquo;s fascinating stuff. I&rsquo;m interested in potentially making one to more deeply understand the concept. Alas, I think this is a the general theme of the topics I&rsquo;m exploring, which creates a bit of an issue with the reality of how much time I have in a day&hellip;</li>
<li>Read about various <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/04/pick-a-license-any-license.html">open source licenses and why I should include one</a>. I like the MIT license, personally. Short, sweet, gives credit and doesn&rsquo;t inhibit for-profit use (probably relates to my own business-friendly bias and what i like to personally see).</li>
<li>Read random posts on <a href="http://www.boredomandlaziness.org/">Nick Coghlan&rsquo;s blog</a>; interesting to get a better sense of the Python community</li>
<li>Hacker School rooftop party &mdash; it was basically all of the coordinators&#8217; birthdays at once. Fun times, fun conversations, and I got a lot of charcoal on myself dealing with the &ldquo;grill&rdquo; (it was basically a fire-pit). Met a lot of great people who are doing some pretty impressive things (&hellip; though we regularly have various software world luminaries come into Hacker School or show up in our internal communications/Humbug anyhow &mdash; fascinating how small the world is and tight knit it is).</li>
</ul>


<h2>23 Jun 2013</h2>

<ul>
<li>Read about Python 3 development and <a href="http://docs.python.org/devguide/coredev.html">how to be a core developer</a>&hellip; not sure about core developer-ship &mdash; I&rsquo;m definitely not there right now &mdash; but I would like to contribute to the Python language in some way. It&rsquo;ll be interesting to keep track and see if I get to a place where I can help out on any of the <a href="http://ncoghlan_devs-python-notes.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html">major places where the community needs help</a></li>
<li>Set up julia-mode for emacs,</li>
<li>Read about <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/interviews/should-you-learn-coffeescript/">CoffeeScript</a>. It&rsquo;s an interesting idea, though I certainly need more practice with base javascript first.</li>
<li>Diverted to CSS preprocessors (SASS and LESS) at least temporarily. Compass seems to give the advantage (somewhat) to SASS, but it seems unlikely that LESS wouldn&rsquo;t include something like it eventually. Given my dislike of working with CSS&rsquo;s syntax/concept in general though, I might try to stay with Bootstrap and AngularJS &mdash; I don&rsquo;t mind someone else figuring out what the right kerning/sizing/font for various headers are and adjusting from there.</li>
<li>Julia workshop with Leah! Intro to the Julia programming language.</li>
</ul>


<h2>24 Jun 2013</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems">Ninety-Nine Haskell Problems</a>, did some of these for <a href="https://github.com/j-wang/99-Haskell-Problems">Haskell practice</a></li>
<li>Wrote a hook to allow my tictactoe AI to play online against other tictactoe AIs. In the process, I got to know Python&rsquo;s urllib a lot better. Unfortunately, I still can&rsquo;t figure out the server&rsquo;s exact API &mdash; and I figure it isn&rsquo;t worth any more effort to fine-tune it, since I won&rsquo;t be getting much learning out of the exercise at this point other than what I need to connect to this specific server.</li>
<li>Code review with Laura on tictactoe &mdash; helpful to hear feedback on code that I did previously, and to see how much I&rsquo;ve improved/wouldn&rsquo;t write things the way I did just a few months ago. It&rsquo;ll be useful to go back and do some code revisions/refactoring myself to crystallize some of my improvement over time (which is hard to see otherwise).</li>
<li>Reviewing <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/">Git Pro</a> in preparation for GitHub training at Jane Street</li>
<li>Listened to a talk by Carin Meier on controlling robots and drones using Clojure! It was hosted by Etsy, which definitely was an interesting location (with a very quirky office).</li>
</ul>


<h2>25 Jun 2013</h2>

<ul>
<li>Went to Intermediate/Advanced Git tutorial hosted at Jane Street Capital this morning. It started a bit slow, but was really useful in bolstering my understanding of the tool, especially coming from a non-professional (programming) background and never having used a lot of the collaboration or branching functionality in a serious way.</li>
<li>Reading <a href="http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/papers/cidr11-bloom.pdf">Berkeley Bloom paper</a> in preparation for Systems discussion group.</li>
<li>Did a code reading for one of the earliest commits for bottle (commit HEAD~820 / SHA hash: 4f50cece28b8ee3ff1c5bcf3f8a7bd1d3bbf6128). It&rsquo;s really interesting to see how the author put together the pieces of it and the design decisions that went into it. My group also discovered a bad bug in the regex/special URL handling that I imagine got fixed in the later revisions (bottle sequentially loops through a list of regexes to match against a URL &mdash; however, this means a more general regex will always match first; compounding on this, there&rsquo;s a semi-random optimizing process that brings more frequently matched regexes forward in the list&hellip; which in the case of a very general match, would ultimately and self-reinforcingly end up in front and block any other matches from ever being reached).</li>
<li>Coming out of the bottle code reading session, I worked with my group in wrangling with the Python <code>@property</code> decorator (and decorator syntax more generally) and <code>@x.setter</code> syntax</li>
<li>Talked with Tom and learned about &ldquo;magic methods&rdquo; and how they work (<code>__get__</code>, <code>__set__</code>, <code>__setattr__</code>, <code>__getattr__</code>, <code>__setattribute__</code>, <code>__getattribute__</code>) &mdash; really interesting, and much more magic than I expect most users would need/understand&hellip; That being said, to really get to understand/know Python, I&rsquo;ll definitely need to understand how those work and how they fit into its evaluation model.</li>
<li>More learning about monads in Haskell from <a href="http://blog.sigfpe.com/2006/08/you-could-have-invented-monads-and.html">yet another blog post</a>. I did a fair number of the exercises, which was useful. I haven&rsquo;t uploaded them to github, but maybe I will later (if I finish them).</li>
<li>For the heck of it, I did learn how <a href="http://lambda.jstolarek.com/2012/10/code-testing-in-haskell/">Haskell testing frameworks work</a> (test-framework, HUnit, QuickCheck2), through testing my Monads tutorial exercises. This definitely was not the cost-effective project to learn this from (given that I probably didn&rsquo;t need tests at all), but I did need to learn sometime. In general, I should tighten up my testing discipline &mdash; out of the major &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; (clean, readable code, clear documentation, etc.), I am currently the most lax/entirely negligent on rigorous and systematic testing. I rely on my &ldquo;mental interpreter&rdquo; too much, which while important, shouldn&rsquo;t substitute for good tests. Not being a professional programmer, I just have never needed the discipline.</li>
<li>In the same vein (best practices and getting to know the Haskell ecosystem at least), I&rsquo;ve been learning about how Haskell modules work.</li>
<li>Reading from Computer Systems: A Programmer&rsquo;s Perspective (Bryant, O&#8217;Hallaron); probably going to continue reading this book and try to do questions from it</li>
</ul>


<h2>26 Jun 2013</h2>

<ul>
<li>Finished reading <a href="http://www.bloom-lang.net/calm/">Bloom paper</a> and researching <a href="http://databeta.wordpress.com/2010/10/28/the-calm-conjecture-reasoning-about-consistency/">CALM</a> principles. These weren&rsquo;t actually the papers I was supposed to read though&hellip; I&rsquo;m hoping they give me a better foundational understanding for Dedalus paper, which we are actually discussing.</li>
<li>Briefly went through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming">logic programming</a>, in order to better understand the Dedalus paper; I certainly barely scratched the surface, but I understand the basics of it now &mdash; hopefully enough for the paper &mdash; after seeing examples like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_clause">Horn clause</a>. Formal logic from philosophy in college is starting to come back to me&hellip;</li>
<li>Discussed <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2009/EECS-2009-173.pdf">Dedalus</a> with Systems reading paper group &mdash; I have a better sense of it now after working through it with the group, though I still don&rsquo;t entirely understand how Dedalus gracefully handles asynchronous data/information &mdash; at least not explicitly. I do understand the idea of how the time stamps would work with eventual consistency (rules come in later that help lead to consistency), but not how they literally make this happen. I&rsquo;ll reread the paper later, but that part seemed a bit fuzzy (though there were certainly enough dense sections that I could have missed it).</li>
<li>More discussion on monads, functors, and their mathematical properties with Nabil, Alex, and Alice</li>
<li>Listened to a talk about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHK-uS-Iedc">miniKanren</a></li>
<li>Set up <a href="http://j-wang.net">octopress blog</a> on github pages with custom domain</li>
<li>Migrated posts (or at least downloaded them) from my Blogger blog</li>
<li>Updated blog colors, poked around how octopress/jekyll liquid templates work</li>
<li>Haskell meetup: I Accidentally the Entire Heap: How I Learned to Love the Profiler. Listened to <a href="https://www.bitba.se/i-accidentally-the-entire-heap/">this presentation</a>. If nothing else, this definitely served as a wake-up call for me to pay a <em>lot</em> more attention to how laziness affects the evaluation of Haskell programs. I imagine my lack of mental model familiarity with it is going to bite me at some point (probably sooner rather than later). Aside from the content of the meetup, I also thought that it was really interesting to see the strong (and seemingly consistent, based on peoples&#8217; familiarity with each other) community around the language. I&rsquo;m going to look forward to seeing what sort of communities there are in the Bay Area.</li>
</ul>


<h2>27 Jun 2013</h2>

<ul>
<li>Came in early this morning to participate in a Javascript seminar led by Mary on javascript (of course) and higher order functions</li>
<li>Discussed characteristics of <code>this</code> in javascript along with how closures work in javascript with Mary</li>
<li>Finished pretty basic implementation (after discussing with Mary) for <a href="https://github.com/j-wang/javascript-exercises">map and reduce</a>. My misunderstanding of <code>this</code> was definitely holding me back from writing better patterns. However, I don&rsquo;t think I love the particular quirks in javascript or its general evaluation/scoping model (yeah, I know, join the club, right?).</li>
<li>Worked a bit more on my <a href="http://j-wang.net">blog</a> (this post will actually be on my blog &mdash; very meta, huh?). Pushed/uploaded posts from my old blog (which is still linking to my blogger site for images&hellip; definitely need to fix that) and pushed updated color scheme. Nothing dramatic, but I do like the slight dash of subtle color, vs. the default octopress black on gray, on white.</li>
<li>It seems I have ended up working a bit longer on my site than I expected. I messed up and did <code>git checkout source</code> (which was behind my detached HEAD in git) &mdash; needed to do a bit of recovery with <code>git reflog</code> and moving everything up to the most-updated blog state. It seems the git tutorial came in handy very quickly after all.</li>
<li>While working on my site anyway, I debugged Disqus comments not working on my site&hellip; after digging into the liquid template, it looked like I needed to specify the comments = true in the front-matter for each page.</li>
<li>I started writing my untyped lambda calculus interpreter in Python (which I probably should have started a few days ago). <a href="https://github.com/j-wang/untyped-lambda-calculus-interpreter">Here&rsquo;s the link to it</a>, though it definitely isn&rsquo;t ready for prime time&hellip; or even to be run. I&rsquo;m currently only as far as the lexer.</li>
<li>I also started it in Haskell (actually flipping between the two for a while&hellip;), but I don&rsquo;t think I have enough experience in it yet to do so efficiently, even though it&rsquo;s likely the more natural fit for an interpreter.</li>
<li>While writing the lexer, I learned a lot about regular expressions (specifically for Python, but also more broadly applicable). Funny how these projects end up creating paths that help me learn things that I never thought I would when I began the project&hellip; (though I probably should have anticipated this for an <em>interpreter</em>).</li>
<li>Read some of &ldquo;The Mythical Man Month.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a very interesting book. Many of the principles/challenges are similar to what I saw in the investment world (creative, technical field). Essentially, I take away that it&rsquo;s important (as I learned in that field) to manage so that you can accomplish what you need to do with a realistic amount of time and available resources &mdash; to crunch it is just to create a train wreck. You might get halfway to your goal, but you didn&rsquo;t get all the way and left a large mess that you&rsquo;ll need to clean up later. I&rsquo;m pretty happy that the field in general seems to care deeply about craftsmanship and code beauty though.</li>
</ul>


<h2>28 Jun 2013</h2>

<ul>
<li>Played D&amp;D with other batch members &mdash; never played before, so it was interesting and fun. I definitely can imagine that one&rsquo;s experience will depend greatly on the group you gather though. Fortunately, we have a good one among Hacker Schoolers!</li>
<li>Read more of &ldquo;The Mythical Man Month&rdquo;</li>
<li>Slowest coding day since I started Hacker School, but at least there was great bonding time!</li>
</ul>
