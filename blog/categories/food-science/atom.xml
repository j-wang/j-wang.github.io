    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For a few months now, I&rsquo;ve been using a $25 deep fryer I found at an estate sale to cook sous vide. It has a bit of a crack and is somewhat old, so I&rsquo;d probably hesitate using it for real deep frying, but I wasn&rsquo;t intending to deep fry with it anyway.</p>

<p>It has a built-in thermocouple, has a nice metal basket with handle to pull the heated food out when done, and already has its own (powerful) heating element &mdash; essentially it has all the components necessary for a good sous vide machine. I even tested its temperature accuracy against a trustworthy thermometer and it came out pretty close. What could be better? (Spoiler alert: There is something much better.)</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Well, one problem is that the lowest temperature setting on it was still rather high. 175 degrees F, its lowest setting, is higher than the temperature you would use to cook most food sous vide. While I&rsquo;d be able to sterilize food in a reliable way, I can&rsquo;t use this thing (or at least its built-in temperature regulation) to get the tender, moist results most people associate with sous vide. The food I produce from this setup closer resembles the output of more conventional cooking techniques.</p>

<p>One solution I could take was to buy an external temperature regulator that simply switched the power for the deep fryer on and off. This would mean that I would be able to use its basket and heating element, but just substitute out the thermoregulation.</p>

<p>However, I stumbled across this post on <a href="http://seattlefoodgeek.com/2010/02/diy-sous-vide-heating-immersion-circulator-for-about-75">Seattle Food Geek</a> and decided that building my own solution would be much more fun. Plus, since this build would be for an immersion circulator type of device instead of an all-in-one machine like the deep fryer (or the Sous Vide Supreme), I could use any size container and accommodate any amount of food.</p>

<p>I essentially followed the instructions given on the site, though I made it modular (I plug in the heating element instead of having it built-in), and mine doesn&rsquo;t look nearly as slick.</p>

<p>There is also an element of electrocution risk in mine, since although I soldered the connections well and topped them with lens caps, there&rsquo;s still a fair amount of naked wire protruding (probably not good for an application that inherently involves being around a large amounts of water). I probably wouldn&rsquo;t feel comfortable leaving it on overnight. Pictures and explanations below:</p>

<p>I did think about using this setup to control my deep fryer, but quickly realized that the built-in relay in my PID is rated for voltage that is WAY lower. I would need to install a more robust external relay in order to actually be able to push the machine to be able to handle that kind of electrical throughput &mdash; at the moment, the PID is barely rated enough for more than one immersion heating element. Putting the external relay in would also require some rewiring to bypass the PID&rsquo;s relay element, which is probably more than I want to do in the near term (I actually have the solid state relay I want to use already). For now, I&rsquo;m pretty happy that I have something that will finally give me my perfectly cooked steaks, chicken, and anything else I want to toss into it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post gets a bit technical and geeky, but I think understanding the theory of cooking is pretty important to cooking well (and consistently). And I can&rsquo;t stop talking about to people in person anyway, so what the heck.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve experimented with a lot of different cooking techniques over time (clay bakers, pressure cookers, etc.), but nothing has really excited me as much as sous vide. What I really love about sous vide is that it lets you very cleanly separate the two essential goals of cooking:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sterilization of food</li>
<li>Tenderizing/texturizing food</li>
</ol>


<!-- more -->


<p>Now, what is it? Sous vide is a cooking technique that aims to evenly cook food through bringing it to a very precisely controlled, even temperature. How it is literally implemented is through placing food in vacuum sealed plastic bags, which are then placed in temperature-controlled water. Vacuum sealing (or, as I prefer, ziplock bagging and pressing out the air) is necessary in order to expose the food to the water more directly. Air is a pretty good insulator, so if it was in between the water and the food, it would prevent the food from getting to the temperature you want it to get to. The water is there because it has a&nbsp;very high specific heat, so it takes a lot of energy to change its temperature. This means it can keep a stable temperature and hold large amount of energy for transfer.</p>

<p>So, what&rsquo;s so great about this? Well, normally, most cooking techniques just blast heat at food in the attempt to sterilize it and give it an appealing texture. Unfortunately, these two goals are often at crossed purposes. To be safe, we normally heat food to a temperature that instantly kills the bacteria we&rsquo;re worried about &mdash; this ensures that it&rsquo;s safe, but often at the cost of taste and texture.&nbsp;Anyone who&rsquo;s eaten a very dry steak can tell you that absolutely-safely-cooked steak is not necessarily tasty steak.</p>

<p>Normally, it&rsquo;s a bit of an iffy proposition when skewing beneath the instant-kill temperature. Bacteria actually die off at lower temperatures than the recommended temperatures we&rsquo;re familiar with (160 &ndash; 165 degrees F for pork, and chicken, 145 degrees F for steak), but they do so gradually. If you cook at lower temperatures, safety requires good timing, which becomes potentially dangerous enough in the wrong hands that the FDA just always cites instant-kill temperatures.</p>

<p>With sous vide, you take the art (and potential food poisoning) out of the picture and add scientific precision. Sous vide machines are usually accurate enough that you know precisely what temperature the food has been at, and then it becomes a simple matter of looking up the amount of time to get to safety on a food pasteurization table. From there, you can have completely safe food (without blasted and barren texture), which, if you want more flavor/texture, you can apply judiciously without the necessity of hitting instant-kill temperature. For example, browning adds flavor through the mallaird reaction (which doesn&rsquo;t happen in sous vide). You can either use a food torch or just toss the steak/chicken/whatever onto a hot pan for a few seconds, keeping the internal texture while getting the browning. You can do sous vide with anything (even just a pot of water, a stove, thermometer, and a lot of patience), but in general machine controlled is better. I recently got a deep fryer at an estate sale that I&rsquo;m not confident in deep-frying in, but can heat water and sous vide with. Unfortunately, the low end of its temperature is still rather high (for sous vide) so I&rsquo;ll probably be experimenting with putting together my own setup soon.</p>
