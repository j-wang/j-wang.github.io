  <div class="entry-content"><br />I&#8217;ve been &#8220;barefoot running&#8221; now for about a year at this point. Overall, I think the results have been better than expected &#8211; though my original expectations were pretty low.<br /><br />While some people get into barefoot running because they&#8217;ve read about the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarahumara_people">Tarahumara</a>, decided it&#8217;s the secret behind African Olympic success in running, or heard some interesting biomechanical or evolutionary argument, I admit that I primarily got into it because the shoes are more compact and easier to carry in my work bag (my company has a gym). Given that benefit, I decided I&#8217;d just hope that some of the other touted benefits were true.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1p3S99dbiLo/UVPEjHshp2I/AAAAAAAAAFw/PxWSlJy5RhY/s1600/IMG_0369.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="480" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1p3S99dbiLo/UVPEjHshp2I/AAAAAAAAAFw/PxWSlJy5RhY/s640/IMG_0369.JPG" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="font-size: 13px;">My Vibram Fivefingers. These squish a lot better than running shoes.</td></tr></tbody></table>One lesson that I would impart on those who might be interested in also trying out barefoot running is to take it slow. For instance, no matter what you do, don&#8217;t make your first major experience barefoot running your first time running a half-marathon. If you do, you might look like this guy:<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TZIUmT8JwU0/UVPFay5p32I/AAAAAAAAAGA/I3uzWSq8vt0/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-03-25+at+11.46.16+PM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TZIUmT8JwU0/UVPFay5p32I/AAAAAAAAAGA/I3uzWSq8vt0/s320/Screen+Shot+2013-03-25+at+11.46.16+PM.png" width="228" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="font-size: 13px;">What a glamour shot. An example of one of many pictures of me taken during the NY13.1. I&#8217;ll happily buy one of these race photos when someone actually takes a flattering picture.</td></tr></tbody></table>This was the Allstate New York 13.1 around April of last year. I didn&#8217;t do too badly for my first half-marathon &#8211; 2:09:28, which is a little under 10 minutes a mile. However, one thing that&#8217;s definitely true with barefoot running and Vibrams is that you&nbsp;<i>feel</i>&nbsp;the road much more. That&#8217;s usually billed as a good thing. That&#8217;s actually less of a good thing near the end of 13 miles, feeling every dip, chip, and rock in the road on your blistering feet.<br /><br />Now, I didn&#8217;t actually go run the half marathon entirely unprepared. I exercise pretty regularly, and during this particular month started ramping up my regime to 3-5 miles each workout (I normally do one at a very fast pace each workout). Despite this (admittedly sparse, but not zero) preparation, the two things that really got me were not enough callouses on the side of my toes and on the ball of my foot (they ripped and tore from the unfamiliar motion/shoes), and not enough calf conditioning.<br /><br />The rips and tears are self-explanatory and probably could stand for me not making them any more graphic. Nowadays, I wear &#8220;toe socks&#8221; so that I don&#8217;t get as much chaffing, which seem to work pretty well (if only I&#8217;d used them for any of my races&#8230; oh well, next time&#8230;). On the calf side, there was a week or two of limping and very staccato stair-stepping (couldn&#8217;t really bend my legs too well &#8211; I kind of looked like a clockwork toy clattering down stairs).<br /><br />Despite my complaining, running barefoot did have one particularly large benefit for me &#8211; the lack of &#8220;arch pain.&#8221; Before barefoot running, I&#8217;d always had extreme pain in my arches (which are actually less arches and more, well, lines) whenever I ran for long periods of time. I originally thought that it had to do with my shoes, but it didn&#8217;t seem like any particular pair of shoes made the problem go away (I had a pair of New Balances that helped a bit, but didn&#8217;t fix it). Although the pain went away a few hours after running, it always vaguely worried me since it didn&#8217;t feel particularly healthy. This time, though I certainly had other complaints, I didn&#8217;t have this particular problem.<br /><br />Since then, I&#8217;ve run another half marathon and a 10k. Both have been &#8220;barefoot&#8221; in Vibrams. I think I&#8217;ll definitely keep running these races, since they give me good exercise &#8220;goals,&#8221; which I&#8217;ve lacked since college crew and martial arts. I&#8217;ll probably also continue to run barefoot as well &#8211; the shoes are still compact and on net it does seem beneficial. Now, if only I could be more photogenic during these things&#8230;<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SDYXBRDQVuc/UVPFO-4lDJI/AAAAAAAAAF4/J6Rd0RY7jJo/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-03-24+at+12.19.22+PM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SDYXBRDQVuc/UVPFO-4lDJI/AAAAAAAAAF4/J6Rd0RY7jJo/s320/Screen+Shot+2013-03-24+at+12.19.22+PM.png" width="214" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="font-size: 13px;">Another example of a photo of me during the Fairfield run. Again, would I like to &#8220;forever remember&#8221; looking like I&#8217;m vaguely constipated?</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br />

  <div class="entry-content">Liz and I were recently up in Philly when I got an idea for a prank that I&#8217;m a couple years too old for at this point. Liz got into UPenn&#8217;s Integrated Product Design master&#8217;s program last week, so we were visiting the city and school to get a sense of whether or not she&#8217;d like the program.<br /><br />At one point, going around the city, we saw this statue very prominently stationed at an intersection.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ttNEtLfQSR8/UVTQhGcZQ2I/AAAAAAAAAGU/3XL3Yw51G7c/s1600/IMG_0354.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ttNEtLfQSR8/UVTQhGcZQ2I/AAAAAAAAAGU/3XL3Yw51G7c/s400/IMG_0354.jpg" width="300" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Deep thought.</td></tr></tbody></table>It kind of looked like it was supposed to be Socrates or something. However, the odd thing was how worn it was. The features were extremely indistinct and it kind of looked like someone had sandblasted it. I doubt that its appearance was caused by the wear of time, since it didn&#8217;t look that old. In reality, some sculptor had probably decided that this was an interesting (if odd) style.<br /><br />Now, even though it probably wasn&#8217;t how it actually got this way, what if someone did&nbsp;sandblast (or sandpaper) it and just left it in this state?<br /><br />Then, I got to thinking &#8211; how baffling and strange a prank would it be to find a statue and in the middle of the night sand it down? I&#8217;m imagining stone statues, wooden cigar store Indians, or one of those foam statues of famous characters sometimes in front of video/comic book stores beckoning you in. You would leave it recognizable, but just make the features indistinct. Make it fuzzy. Then, after doing the deed, you would clean away the dust to make it look like nothing ever happened. I would imagine, for at least a few seconds, maybe up to a minute, someone familiar with the statue would go up to it and be completely baffled, trying (and perhaps failing) to comprehend what happened. The idea of bafflement and people trying to figure out what happened, along with the pure physical difficulty in executing the prank (partially what makes it so unthinkable), is what makes this so amusing to me. After all, I was baffled myself with this statue and it probably isn&#8217;t even what happened here.<br /><br />As said, I&#8217;m too old for this since this is more of a college kid type of thing (especially since it might be a LONG night of sandpapering). And even in college, I&#8217;m still not sure I&#8217;d do this, since I think I&#8217;d feel bad (unless the statue was really bad). Thinking about it did give me a moment of devious amusement though.

  <div class="entry-content">For Valentine&#8217;s Day, I surprised Liz with an iPad Mini. We were selling her current Macbook Air because it just didn&#8217;t have the power to run Solidworks, Autocad, and other technical programs she&#8217;d soon need for her engineering/design classes. However, she attached a fair amount of sentimental value to that particular Macbook Air (it was another surprise gift from me). I figured I&#8217;d at least update the sentimental value with the iPad because it filled her need for a portable device and she had liked the Mini when we visited an Apple Store recently.<br /><br />For her gift, she surprised me with a Raspberry Pi. In a pie.<br /><br />Apparently, she had searched for a good &#8220;pie proxy&#8221; as a presentation tool for the Raspberry Pi but eventually, for lack of a better option, settled on an actual pie (blueberry, but close enough). I don&#8217;t have a picture of the pie, unfortunately, but I do have a picture of the blueberry stained box, which I vacuum sealed afterwards in case I needed any of the numbers on it (it&#8217;d otherwise be sticky and good luck cleaning off the box without destroying it).<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hLfdyViskBk/UVTNq2SgwYI/AAAAAAAAAGM/HeRkyDWZD00/s1600/IMG_0356.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hLfdyViskBk/UVTNq2SgwYI/AAAAAAAAAGM/HeRkyDWZD00/s400/IMG_0356.jpg" width="300" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I suppose this might have been a problem if I needed to return it.</td></tr></tbody></table>I suppose we&#8217;re a bit of an odd couple, but I wouldn&#8217;t have it any other way.

  <div class="entry-content">One thing that has bothered me about all of my experimentation with sous vide cooking is that everything that I&#8217;ve done could technically be done with normal cooking methods. Despite making the best chicken, steak, and poached eggs (or the only poached eggs) that I&#8217;ve ever made, it was possible for me to still cook this food with more conventional methods. I wanted something that is largely unachievable with any other method.<br /><br />Enter the deep-fried porchetta, which I was inspired to make from <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2011/12/the-food-lab-deep-fried-sous-vide-36-hour-all-belly-porchetta.html?ref=search">this recipe</a>.<br /><br />It pretty much captures <a href="http://jwang10.blogspot.com/2012/01/theory-of-sous-vide.html">what I love</a> about sous vide &#8211; the ability to separate sterilizing food from creating the texture of food. Porchetta is hard because it&#8217;s difficult to fully cook the meat, keep the inside tender, and make the outside crispy (but not dry) all at the same time. That&#8217;s because there&#8217;s only one blunt object method of cooking it used (dry heat blasted outside in). Here, we can elegantly separate the parts (sterilization and tenderizing, vs. crisping&#8230; or deep-frying) by using separate cooking techniques, the key ones being sous vide and deep-frying. I couldn&#8217;t wait to try it.<br /><br />Because this thing was going to need to run overnight, I didn&#8217;t want to chance burning down my apartment with my homemade sous vide machine. I figured I made enough food with sous vide that it would be worth it to finally spring for a real immersion circulator (Williams-Sonoma&#8217;s Sous Vide Professional, after deciding that it was too much trouble making sure used lab circulators on Ebay didn&#8217;t have deadly residue).<br /><br />The recipe above calls for pork belly, but I didn&#8217;t want to do pork belly. I couldn&#8217;t find it at my local butcher (&#8230; Stop-and-Shop) and I make food to eat over many meals. Pork belly would be too rich and would become painful to continue eating relatively quickly (it&#8217;s quite far past the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/23/health/23well.html?_r=0">bliss point</a>). Instead, I chose to go with 10lbs of skin-on pork shoulder, which I got tied and scored at Stop-and-Shop (it&#8217;s important to get it tied &#8211; refuse to get it scored if you must, but the thing will fall apart on you if you don&#8217;t have extra support from the ties).&nbsp;I figured it was a bit of a waste to go much smaller, since I&#8217;d still have the fixed cost of going through all the steps of making this thing regardless of how big it was. As it turns out, if I went smaller, I might have ended up with less oil burns and less stress trying to manhandle a massive hunk of hot pork, but hindsight is 20/20&#8230;<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-oNs7yzVt0CI/UVEA8OJJdkI/AAAAAAAAAEQ/_n3w5lkLwJY/s1600/IMG_9462.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="425" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-oNs7yzVt0CI/UVEA8OJJdkI/AAAAAAAAAEQ/_n3w5lkLwJY/s640/IMG_9462.JPG" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">The pork shoulder fresh from the store. Looks far smaller at this distance than it feels trying to move it while hot.</td></tr></tbody></table>After getting it back from the store, I prepared the spice blend I wanted to use (toasted fennel seed, black pepper, sage, rosemary, thyme, and crushed red pepper &#8211; I wanted to go with fennel pollen, but I took a look at the expense and decided maybe another time). The toasted fennel seed and black pepper mix gets pretty aromatic when you&#8217;re making it, which is great. Make sure you don&#8217;t use oil though, since it&#8217;s meant to toast dry. After toasting the seeds and peppers on the stove until deep brown, I blended them and coated them onto the shoulder, along with the other spices.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2lYxlxkT2X0/UVEDJTHN2cI/AAAAAAAAAEY/FWybEdwYc9o/s1600/IMG_9474.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="425" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2lYxlxkT2X0/UVEDJTHN2cI/AAAAAAAAAEY/FWybEdwYc9o/s640/IMG_9474.JPG" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Adding spices. Make sure to get it into the crevices and into the butterfly cut (if you actually got it &#8211; I didn&#8217;t here because I wanted to just go with the pre-tied meat). It&#8217;s literally painful trying to tie your own meat if you&#8217;re bad at slipknots (like I am).</td></tr></tbody></table><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-V3DeUm0yfz0/UVEEM_zu1eI/AAAAAAAAAEg/zqasUizkVZg/s1600/IMG_9510.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-V3DeUm0yfz0/UVEEM_zu1eI/AAAAAAAAAEg/zqasUizkVZg/s640/IMG_9510.JPG" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Salt is also important. Even if you&#8217;re worried about salt, most of it is going to &#8220;wash off&#8221; with the liquids that come out of the meat during cooking.</td></tr></tbody></table><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kqeDiqg4jjs/UVEEteqU1GI/AAAAAAAAAEo/rOAt92TEo04/s1600/IMG_9587.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kqeDiqg4jjs/UVEEteqU1GI/AAAAAAAAAEo/rOAt92TEo04/s640/IMG_9587.JPG" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">The finished product. Well, raw finished product.</td></tr></tbody></table>After patting the meat down well with spices and salt, I just needed to load it into the sous vide and used a jumbo hefty bag (2.5 gallons) as my &#8220;vacuum bag.&#8221; It was far more painful than the picture suggests given the size of this thing and the logistics of trying to load a 10 pound pork shoulder with one hand and keep the bag open with the other. Additionally, the hefty bag leaks slightly, which was annoying for me and could be even more problematic for you if you chose to buy one of those potentially deadly immersion circulators from Ebay. Prior to this episode, I always used simple ziplock bags, which basically work as well as vacuum seal bags for most applications and can actually handle liquids (which get sucked out by normal vacuum sealers, unless you spring for a chamber vacuum). If you lower a ziplock bag into warm-to-hot water, the pressure from the water (more heat = more molecular movement/bouncing) pushes out the air.<br /><br />After this episode, I&#8217;ve moved on to bulk vacuum seal bags (really big ones and 200 ft of them) bought from an online restaurant supply store to be used with a simple Foodsaver vacuum (which Liz got practically for free from a thrift store). But again, that&#8217;s not to say that the simple technique doesn&#8217;t work, which I want to emphasize because I&#8217;ve heard from some people that the cost of the equipment deters them from cooking sous vide. If it wasn&#8217;t for the fact that I&#8217;d make porchetta again and was able to obtain the necessary equipment on the cheap, I&#8217;d probably still be using ziplock bags.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-igHBOMR-d_Y/UVEHkL0xWuI/AAAAAAAAAEw/tE0S1iVRO2Y/s1600/IMG_9630.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-igHBOMR-d_Y/UVEHkL0xWuI/AAAAAAAAAEw/tE0S1iVRO2Y/s640/IMG_9630.JPG" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">This looks far smoother than it actually went.</td></tr></tbody></table><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-15HMb95YkLA/UVEJiOdE3eI/AAAAAAAAAE4/rsS3fRz-QYs/s1600/IMG_9723.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-15HMb95YkLA/UVEJiOdE3eI/AAAAAAAAAE4/rsS3fRz-QYs/s640/IMG_9723.JPG" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Looks tranquil in there.</td></tr></tbody></table>The recipe calls for 155 degrees F for 36 hours but I didn&#8217;t want to wait that long. I squinted at bit at the pasteurization curves for meat and figured out that 165 degrees F for 24 hours would suffice instead to sterilize the pork. I expected that the temperature difference wouldn&#8217;t have much of an adverse effect on the texture either.<br /><br />When 24 hours finally passed, it was time to deep fry. I went with the recipe&#8217;s suggestion to use a wok with oil (I used canola because of its high smoke point, relative healthiness, and price), since my thift-store deep-fryer isn&#8217;t big enough and while I was fine with sous vide cooking with it, I&#8217;m not confident enough in it to go high-temp with oil.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0Xcskh17_fs/UVEMmvee2QI/AAAAAAAAAFA/zLjsUT9j-Zg/s1600/IMG_9769.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="425" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0Xcskh17_fs/UVEMmvee2QI/AAAAAAAAAFA/zLjsUT9j-Zg/s640/IMG_9769.JPG" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Pouring the canola oil.

I think I need rubber gloves since although the shoulder was cooked at sub-boiling temperatures, it is still really hot for bare hands. I first poured off the juice/sauce/drippings into a bowl for gravy later and (for lack of better tools) grabbed the pork with my hands and manhandled it into the wok. It made a nice dual oil splash from the impact and the contact of residual moisture with the oil.

  <div class="entry-content">For a few months now, I&#8217;ve been using a $25 deep fryer I found at an estate sale to cook sous vide. It has a bit of a crack and is somewhat old, so I&#8217;d probably hesitate using it for real deep frying, but I wasn&#8217;t intending to deep fry with it anyway.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NJI74C4YqDQ/UVTdTUmZZ9I/AAAAAAAAAGc/SM5yvB6_r1k/s1600/IMG_0370.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NJI74C4YqDQ/UVTdTUmZZ9I/AAAAAAAAAGc/SM5yvB6_r1k/s640/IMG_0370.jpg" width="480" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">This thing was definitely a steal for the price&#8230; though maybe not for someone who actually wanted to do some deep frying &#8211; you&#8217;d have to factor in potential medical bills.</td></tr></tbody></table>It has a built-in thermocouple, has a nice metal basket with handle to pull the heated food out when done, and already has its own (powerful) heating element &#8211; essentially it has all the components necessary for a good sous vide machine. I even tested its temperature accuracy against a trustworthy thermometer and it came out pretty close. What could be better?<br /><br />Well, one problem is that the lowest temperature setting on it was still rather high. 175 degrees F, its lowest setting, is higher than the temperature you would use to cook most food sous vide. While I&#8217;d be able to sterilize food in a reliable way, I can&#8217;t use this thing (or at least its built-in temperature regulation) to get the tender, moist results most people associate with sous vide. The food I produce from this setup closer resembles the output of more conventional cooking techniques.<br /><br />One solution I could take was to buy an external temperature regulator that simply switched the power for the deep fryer on and off. This would mean that I would be able to use its basket and heating element, but just substitute out the thermoregulation.<br /><br />However, I stumbled across this post on <a href="http://seattlefoodgeek.com/2010/02/diy-sous-vide-heating-immersion-circulator-for-about-75/">Seattle Food Geek</a>&nbsp;and decided that building my own solution would be much more fun. Plus, since this build would be for an immersion circulator type of device instead of an all-in-one machine like the deep fryer (or the Sous Vide Supreme), I could use any size container and accommodate any amount of food.<br /><br />I essentially followed the instructions given on the site, though I made it modular (I plug in the heating element instead of having it built-in), and mine doesn&#8217;t look nearly as slick.<br /><br />There is also an element of electrocution risk in mine, since although I soldered the connections well and topped them with lens caps, there&#8217;s still a fair amount of naked wire protruding (probably not good for an application that inherently involves being around a large amounts of water). I probably wouldn&#8217;t feel comfortable leaving it on overnight.

I would need to install a more robust external relay in order to actually be able to push the machine to be able to handle that kind of electrical throughput &#8211; at the moment, the PID is barely rated enough for more than one immersion heating element. Putting the external relay in would also require some rewiring to bypass the PID&#8217;s relay element, which is probably more than I want to do in the near term (I actually have the solid state relay I want to use already). For now, I&#8217;m pretty happy that I have something that will finally give me my perfectly cooked steaks, chicken, and anything else I want to toss into it.

  <div class="entry-content">This post gets a bit technical and geeky, but I think understanding the theory of cooking is pretty important to cooking well (and consistently). And I can&#8217;t stop talking about to people in person anyway, so what the heck.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve experimented with a lot of different cooking techniques over time (clay bakers, pressure cookers, etc.), but nothing has really excited me as much as sous vide. What I really love about sous vide is that it lets you very cleanly separate the two essential goals of cooking:<br /><ol><li>Sterilization of food</li><li>Tenderizing/texturizing food</li></ol>Now, what is it? Sous vide is a cooking technique that aims to evenly cook food through bringing it to a very precisely controlled, even temperature. How it is literally implemented is through placing food in vacuum sealed plastic bags, which are then placed in temperature-controlled water. Vacuum sealing (or, as I prefer, ziplock bagging and pressing out the air) is necessary in order to expose the food to the water more directly. Air is a pretty good insulator, so if it was in between the water and the food, it would prevent the food from getting to the temperature you want it to get to. The water is there because it has a&nbsp;very high specific heat, so it takes a lot of energy to change its temperature. This means it can keep a stable temperature and hold large amount of energy for transfer.<br /><br />So, what&#8217;s so great about this? Well, normally, most cooking techniques just blast heat at food in the attempt to sterilize it and give it an appealing texture. Unfortunately, these two goals are often at crossed purposes. To be safe, we normally heat food to a temperature that instantly kills the bacteria we&#8217;re worried about &#8211; this ensures that it&#8217;s safe, but often at the cost of taste and texture.&nbsp;Anyone who&#8217;s eaten a very dry steak can tell you that absolutely-safely-cooked steak is not necessarily tasty steak.<br /><br />Normally, it&#8217;s a bit of an iffy proposition when skewing beneath the instant-kill temperature. Bacteria actually die off at lower temperatures than the recommended temperatures we&#8217;re familiar with (160 - 165 degrees F for pork, and chicken, 145 degrees F for steak), but they do so gradually. If you cook at lower temperatures, safety requires good timing, which becomes potentially dangerous enough in the wrong hands that the FDA just always cites instant-kill temperatures.<br /><br />With sous vide, you take the art (and potential food poisoning) out of the picture and add scientific precision. Sous vide machines are usually accurate enough that you know precisely what temperature the food has been at, and then it becomes a simple matter of looking up the amount of time to get to safety on a food pasteurization table. From there, you can have completely safe food (without blasted and barren texture), which, if you want more flavor/texture, you can apply judiciously without the necessity of hitting instant-kill temperature. For example, browning adds flavor through the mallaird reaction (which doesn&#8217;t happen in sous vide). You can either use a food torch or just toss the steak/chicken/whatever onto a hot pan for a few seconds, keeping the internal texture while getting the browning. You can do sous vide with anything (even just a pot of water, a stove, thermometer, and a lot of patience), but in general machine controlled is better. I recently got a deep fryer at an estate sale that I&#8217;m not confident in deep-frying in, but can heat water and sous vide with. Unfortunately, the low end of its temperature is still rather high (for sous vide) so I&#8217;ll probably be experimenting with putting together my own setup soon.
